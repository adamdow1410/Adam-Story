# Adam-Story
An amazing story about Adam
The day was bright and no clouds in the sky.
I was warming up for my championship water polo game.
I could hear the crowd roaring with excitement for the game.
I was thinking of what tactics and plays I will be responsible.
If only I knew what was to come ahead...
