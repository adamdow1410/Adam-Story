# Adam-Story
An amazing story about Adam
The day was bright and no clouds in the sky.
I was warming up for my championship water polo game.
I could hear the crowd roaring with excitement for the game.
I was thinking of what tactics and plays I will be responsible.
If only I knew what was to come ahead...
As the game was about to start, I became so nervous.
I tried to calm down but I could not stop shaking.
The next thing I knew the game had started.
The fast pace of the game was something I was used to, but my nerves were getting the best of me.
I did not know what to do.
